Advanced Problem Suite for Large Language Models (LLMs)

This suite presents a curated set of problems designed explicitly to challenge and evaluate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering scenarios. Unlike conventional coding platforms such as LeetCode that emphasize algorithmic problem-solving, this suite dives into real-world software development challenges, akin to those found in professional settings.


1. Key features of this suite include:

Production-Grade Application Development: Each test focuses on the creation of components or solutions that are part of real-world, production-grade applications. It isn't just about writing functional code; it's about writing maintainable, scalable, and efficient code fit for deployment.

Automated Solution Verification: The answers generated by the LLM can be verified using unit tests tailored for each problem. This ensures that the solution isn't merely syntactically correct but functionally sound and meets the predefined requirements.

Emphasis on Quality: The suite assesses the ability to produce high-quality software deliverables. It evaluates best practices, design patterns, and other aspects of software quality.

Bridging the Gap to Autonomous Software Development: The end goal of such evaluations is to determine if LLMs can, one day, autonomously handle complex software engineering tasks without human supervision. Achieving proficiency in these tests indicates a significant leap towards that future, where LLMs could potentially orchestrate entire software projects or even spawn software companies autonomously.

This suite is a step towards understanding and harnessing the potential of LLMs in the vast landscape of software engineering, pushing the boundaries of autonomous artificial intelligence in real-world applications.


2. How to Run the Benchmark

a. Setup:

Prepare a development environment with the necessary software tools, databases, and frameworks depending on the specific benchmark.
Ensure an automated testing setup is in place, tailored to the specific benchmark in question.
b. Distribution:

Present the benchmark problem to the LLM or the candidate.
Provide all necessary data, mock systems, or additional resources they might need.
c. Execution:

Allow the LLM or candidate to solve the problem, ensuring they adhere to the requirements and best practices.
Once the solution is submitted, run the predefined unit tests or evaluation scripts against the solution.
d. Evaluation:

The benchmark has predefined metrics, usually in the form of a percentage score, indicating how close the solution is to the ideal.
Collate results and analyze based on the metric criteria.


3. Novelty of the Benchmark

Traditional coding challenges, like those seen on platforms such as LeetCode, emphasize algorithmic thinking and problem-solving in isolation. In contrast, this benchmark:

Real-world Scenarios: Models challenges that mirror real-world software development and system design issues.

Emphasis on Quality: Focuses not just on solving a problem but on how it's solved, ensuring the solution is production-ready.

Diverse Software Engineering Aspects: Covers various fields such as system design, microservices, database optimization, and more, providing a holistic assessment.

Automated Evaluation: Uses automated testing and scoring to provide objective feedback on the solutions.


4. What It Assesses

a. Technical Proficiency: The ability to correctly implement a solution that meets the problem's requirements.

b. Architectural Understanding: Skills in designing systems, whether they're microservices architectures, databases, or full-fledged applications.

c. Best Practices: Adherence to industry best practices, ensuring the solution is maintainable, scalable, and robust.

d. Real-world Application: The ability to develop solutions that can be directly applied in a production environment, rather than just theoretical or algorithmic solutions.

e. Performance and Optimization: Understanding of how to make software efficient, optimized, and performant.

f. Security and Robustness: Skills in ensuring the software is secure from potential threats and can handle unexpected scenarios gracefully.
