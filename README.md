# **Large Language Models (LLMs) Testing Framework**

A framework for testing LLM in creating producation ready code. The architecture uses a "junior dev" LLM agent which creates the code and a "grader" LLM agent which grades the code based on a rubric. Upon completion, a score out of 100 is assigned. Example problem sets are found in the /tests folder. You can add your own by adding more .json files in /tests.

## **1. Key Features of This Suite Include:**

- **Production-Grade Application Development:** Each test focuses on the creation of components or solutions that are part of real-world, production-grade applications. It isn't just about writing functional code; it's about writing maintainable, scalable, and efficient code fit for deployment.

- **Automated Solution Verification:** The answers generated by the LLM can be verified automatically using the grader LLM agent. 

- **Bridging the Gap to Autonomous Software Development:** The end goal of such evaluations is to determine if LLMs can, one day, autonomously handle complex software engineering tasks without human supervision. Achieving proficiency in these tests indicates a significant leap towards that future, where LLMs could potentially orchestrate entire software projects or even spawn software companies autonomously.

## **2. How to Run the Application**

### a. Setup:
- Prepare your development environment ensuring you have the necessary software tools installed, including Python and pip (Python's package installer).
- It's advisable to work within a virtual environment to manage dependencies for your project and ensure its requirements are isolated from the global environment.

### b. Creating a Virtual Environment:
- Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
- Run the following command to create a virtual environment named `venv` (you can name it anything you prefer):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
- This will create a virtual environment in the project directory which will help to keep dependencies required by different projects separate.

### c. Activating the Virtual Environment:
- To activate the virtual environment, run:
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
- Once activated, the virtual environment will isolate your Python environment from the global environment.

### d. Installing Dependencies:
- With the virtual environment activated, you can now install the project's dependencies using pip. Run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- This will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### e. Running the Application:
- Now that the dependencies are installed, you can run the application by executing the following command:
    ```bash
    python -m main.py
    ```

## **3. Novelty of the Benchmark**

Traditional coding challenges, like those seen on platforms such as LeetCode, emphasize algorithmic thinking and problem-solving in isolation. In contrast, this benchmark:

- **Real-world Scenarios:** Models challenges that mirror real-world software development and system design issues.
- **Emphasis on Quality:** Focuses not just on solving a problem but on how it's solved, ensuring the solution is production-ready.
- **Automated Evaluation:** Uses automated testing and scoring to provide objective feedback on the solutions.
